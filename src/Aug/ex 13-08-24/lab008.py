'''
lets create a a simple calculator programme using input function.
for the first we need to conver string into integer by adding the "int". As shown below.
'''
num1 =int(input("a"))
num2 =int(input("b"))
print("add", num1+num2)
print("sub", num1-num2)
print("mul", num1*num2)
print("div", num1/num2)
'''# interview question: divison output is always a float.
                                             #output of input funcvtion is always strg.
                                             #if anything is in double quotes" " it is a string, either it is number. 
                                             a = "45", It is a string.
